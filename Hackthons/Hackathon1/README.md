# Hackathon 1 - Cross-site Scripting Attacks and Defenses

## The lab's overview
In my XSS exploitation endeavors, I successfully compromised Levels 2, 4, 5, and 6 of the target web application while encountering difficulties with Level 3. My methods involved crafting and executing JavaScript payloads through various injection points, showcasing vulnerabilities in the application's input handling mechanisms.

### Level 2
For Level 2, I utilized a POST request to inject an XSS payload into the application. By submitting a crafted payload through the console, I triggered an alert message, demonstrating the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the target page.
