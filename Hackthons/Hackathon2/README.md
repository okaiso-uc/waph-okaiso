# Hackathon 1 - Cross-site Scripting Attacks and Defenses

## Overview and Requirements

This hackathon consists of three levels with multiple sub-tasks.

### Level 0
- **Description**: I  Injected SQL code to show my University’s username to bypass the login check and successfully log in to the system.

### Level 1
- **Description**: Guessed the SQL string in the back-end and injected SQL code with your University’s username to bypass the login check and successfully log in to the system.

### Level 2
The objective of Level 2 is to demonstrate advanced SQL injection techniques to exploit vulnerabilities in a more secure environment.


#### a. Detecting SQLi Vulnerabilities

- **Description**: Explored the application to identify potential SQLi vulnerabilities and discovered vulnerable parts of the application.

#### b. Exploiting SQLi to Access Data

**i. Identify the Number of Columns**:

- **Description**: Used SQL injection techniques to determine the number of columns in the database table.

**ii. Display Your Information**:

- **Description**: Injected SQL code to display university username, name, and section on the page.

**iii. Display the Database Schema**:

- **Description**: Exploited SQLi vulnerabilities to retrieve the entire database schema.

**iv. Display Login Credentials**:

- **Description**: Identified the table and columns storing usernames and passwords. Constructed an SQLi query to display all usernames and passwords stored in the database.

#### c. Login with Stolen Credentials

- **Description**: Used the stolen credentials to log in to the system.

## Conclusion

Successfully completed all sub-tasks of Level 2, demonstrating proficiency in advanced SQL injection techniques.
